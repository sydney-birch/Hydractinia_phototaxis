## Behavior analysis overview

This directory contains the raw behavioral data collected (count data), the r script to analyze the data using t-tests, and the csv file used to create the figure in the paper.

In this behavior study, we exposed larvae to three wavelengths of light, red (625 nm), blue (470nm), and green (523 nm), for eight hours and assessed (counted) the number of larvae that had migrated to within 1cm of the light stimulus.
