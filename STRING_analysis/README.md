## STRING analysis 

We performed a STRING analysis using the STRING database (https://string-db.org/cgi/input?sessionId=bo0WKz2Soxv3) to investigate the protien-protien interactions of the candidate Hydractinia planlua genes. We examined this by using the human gene symbols that labled orthogroups (from OrthoFinder) that contained Hydractinia sequences. The spreadsheet organizes all of the gene symbols and includes the significantly differentially expressed genes (for each developmental day and combined), the Full gene set, the genes that are expressed (but not significantly differentially expressed), and the genes that are not expressed (orthogroups that did not contain Hydractinia sequences). Below is the step-by-step guide for the settings and the analysis. 


### Step-by-Step Analysis and Settings

1. We copied the genes of interest and searched them in the database under the multiple protiens tab and selected Human as the organism. 

2. Once the search completes, we adjusted the Settings to the following: 
  ... Network type: Full STRING network
  ... meaning of network edges: Confidence
  ... active interaction sources: All selected
  ... Network display options: disable structure previews inside network bubbles and show query protien names

3. Under the analysis tab we recorded the network statistics and selected Geno Ontology and Annotated Keywords (UniProt) of interest ensuring that we highlighted the terms in the same colors across our different Networks generated.
