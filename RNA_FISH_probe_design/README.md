# RNA Fluorescent in situ Hybridization (FISH) Probe Design Overview

This directory contains the step-by-step instructions for designing RNA Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) probes for Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus larvae (Hydrozoa) using Stellaris Custom RNA FISH Probe sets https://www.biosearchtech.com/products/rna-fish/custom-stellaris-probe-sets. I designed these probes based on the results of the gene expression work and outputs which will be refered to here.

Follow the step-by-step instructions of the workflow: RNA_Probes_workflow.md
Scripts for this section can be found in the directory: Probe_design_scripts
