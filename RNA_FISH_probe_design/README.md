# RNA Fluorescent in situ Hybridization (FISH) Probe Design Overview

This directory contains the step-by-step instructions for designing RNA Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) probes for Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus larvae (Hydrozoa) using Stellaris Custom RNA FISH Probe sets https://www.biosearchtech.com/products/rna-fish/custom-stellaris-probe-sets. I designed these probes based on the results of the gene expression work and outputs which will be refered to here. This is the same workflow we previously developed, which can be found in my Actinula_paper repository (https://github.com/sjb1061/Actinula_Paper). 

Follow the step-by-step instructions of the workflow: RNA_Probes_workflow.md

Scripts for this section can be found in the directory: Probe_design_scripts

Inputs and Outputs can be found in the directory: Probe_design_inputs_and_outputs
