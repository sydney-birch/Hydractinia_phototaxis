# Hydractinia_phototaxis

This repository contains the analyses for the manuscript: Phototactic preference and its genetic basis in the planulae of the colonial Hydrozoan _Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus_ (in progress). This includes the behavioral analysis code, the developmental transcriptome and gene expression analysis workflow, the STRING analysis workflow, and the design of RNA FISH probes.

All transcriptome/gene expression scripts and workflow can be found in the Transcriptome_analysis/scripts_for_analysis folder. For a detailed explaination and step by step instruction of this analysis, please see the step_by_step_transcriptome_analysis.md file. Raw Reads used in this analysis can be found on the SRA database, accession ID: PRJNA1046120. 

The Hydractinia_Behavior_Analysis folder contains the R scripts and data used for analysing the phototaxis experiement and generating figures.

The STRING_analysis folder contains the workflow for the STRING analysis for three gene sets.

Lastly, the RNA_FISH_Probe_Design folder contains the workflow for generating RNA FISH probes.


_We are following a workflow we previously developed for the transcriptome analysis and design of RNA FISH probes - this can be found in my Actinula_paper repository_ (https://github.com/sjb1061/Actinula_Paper) for the following manuscript: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.16968
